## JD Bill-An Supply Chain Finance Platform

Bank acceptance bills have become a low-risk financial instrument commonly used by many small, medium and micro enterprises due to their short term, high convenience and strong liquidity. Through discounted bills, companies can turn the "bills" in their hands into "cash" and accelerate corporate funds Turnover, improve the efficiency of capital use. 

However, the long-term asymmetry of information between small and medium-sized enterprises and financial institutions, which has led to the realization of bill financing, has always been a pain for small and medium-sized enterprises. Bank credit and discount procedures are complicated, intermediary market financing risks are high and intermediaries cannot provide compliance discount vouchers.

 In response to the above problems, this system aims to solve the small, micro, short, and urgent needs of small and medium-sized enterprises, open the bottleneck of the connection between assets and funds, and build a "bridge" between enterprises and financial institutions to provide compliance, efficiency, efficiency and convenient service.
